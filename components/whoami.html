	<p>Everyday, people create amazing things and I am taking part in it. Building, developping, making, creating are taking a big part in my life and one of the most convenient way to do it is using computers. It's also a good medium to do things fast.<br>
	I'm passionated about computers and especially software since I was a teenager. Today, being a programer helps me to solve everyday problems and try to invent new things to help people or to entertain them.</p>

	<p>Open source software has also really helped me to learn and to develop. That's why I'm also trying to take part of it by publishing my personnal work online, hoping that my creations can help anybody to learn computer science.</p>

	<p>During my studies, I began doing a Bachelor in Computer Science at EPFL (Federal Polytechnical School) but it was a bit too theorical for me and I often wanted to implement what we saw in class. At HEIG-VD (University of applied sciences â€“ Engineering and Business School) we actually do it a lot and I find it much more pleasant and closer to the reality. Having taking part of both schools showed me both parts of today company's requirements.</p>
